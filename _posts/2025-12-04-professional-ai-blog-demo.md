### Neural Networks Evolution

Deep neural networks have evolved significantly:

{% raw %}
```python
# Example: Modern Neural Network Architecture
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ModernAI(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(ModernAI, self).__init__()
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(...)
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(...)
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Advanced processing
        return self.output(x)
```
{% endraw %}
